It groups together data points that are closely packed and separates regions of lower density. It works by defining a neighborhood around each data point and identifying core points, which have a sufficient number of neighboring points within a specified distance. It then expands the clusters by connecting core points to their nearby points and iteratively including the reachable points in the clusters. The algorithm assigns points as core points, border points, or noise points based on their connectivity and density.\n",
