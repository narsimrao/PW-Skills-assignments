    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to address the problem of multicollinearity and control the complexity of the model. It differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a penalty term to the cost function. While OLS regression aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals, Ridge Regression incorporates a regularization term, known as the L2 norm penalty, that shrinks the coefficients towards zero. This helps to reduce the impact of less important predictors and prevent overfitting.\n",
