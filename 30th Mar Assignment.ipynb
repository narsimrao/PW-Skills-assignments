    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It addresses some limitations of these individual techniques by adding both L1 and L2 norm penalty terms to the cost function. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity and feature selection, similar to Lasso Regression, while the L2 penalty encourages coefficient shrinkage towards zero, similar to Ridge Regression. By combining the two penalties, Elastic Net Regression offers a flexible approach for dealing with high-dimensional datasets, multicollinearity, and feature selection.\n",
